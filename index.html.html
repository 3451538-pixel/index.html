        <h3>Troubleshooting & Extra Information</h3>
        <p>This section consolidates common issues, checks, and step-by-step solutions to help diagnose and fix gradebook problems quickly.</p>

        <h4>Common issues</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Missing grades — check activity settings and gradebook setup.</li>
          <li>Wrong calculations — verify aggregation methods and category weights.</li>
          <li>Import failures — check file format and data integrity.</li>
          <li>Permission errors — review role capabilities and activity settings.</li>
          <li>Display problems — clear cache and check browser compatibility.</li>
          <li>Performance issues — optimize settings for large courses.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Troubleshooting calculations</h4>
        <p>When calculations seem incorrect:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Verify aggregation method matches your intended calculation (Mean, Weighted, Sum, etc.).</li>
          <li>Check category weights sum appropriately (total 100% where required).</li>
          <li>Look for empty grades affecting averages — confirm whether "Aggregate only non-empty grades" is set.</li>
          <li>Confirm 'Aggregate only non-empty grades' and excluded items settings.</li>
          <li>Review excluded items and hidden grade items.</li>
          <li>Check category min/max values and validation rules.</li>
          <li>Test with simple examples (create two items and verify expected results).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Missing grades — quick fixes</h4>
        <p>If grades are missing from your gradebook:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Check the activity is set to "Send grades to gradebook" in activity settings.</li>
          <li>Verify the activity has a grade item created in the gradebook.</li>
          <li>Ensure students have submitted work (or a grade was entered).</li>
          <li>Refresh the gradebook view after making changes.</li>
          <li>Look for the grade item in the correct category and confirm aggregation settings.</li>
          <li>Ensure the aggregation is set to "Mean of grades (with empty grades)" or the correct mode for your needs.</li>
          <li>Verify activity completion settings if completion auto-creates grades.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Export issues & tips</h4>
        <p>Common problems when exporting:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Character encoding issues — use UTF-8 encoding for international characters.</li>
          <li>Missing data — check export settings and filters; include all desired items.</li>
          <li>Format errors — ensure proper CSV structure with headers and delimiters.</li>
          <li>Permission denied — verify export capabilities in your role.</li>
          <li>Large file issues — export in smaller batches for courses with many students.</li>
          <li>Formula cells — exported CSV will not preserve calculated formulas from spreadsheet programs; export raw values when needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Step-by-step gradebook setup</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to Administration > Grades > Setup > Gradebook setup.</li>
          <li>Click "Add category" to create main assessment categories (e.g., Assignments, Quizzes, Exams).</li>
          <li>Choose an aggregation method for each category — typically "Weighted mean of grades" for flexible weighting.</li>
          <li>Assign weights to each category based on your syllabus (total 100%).</li>
          <li>Add individual grade items or link activities to the gradebook and assign them to categories.</li>
          <li>Configure grade item settings: max/min values, drop lowest, exclude empty grades, etc.</li>
          <li>Test calculations with sample grades and adjust boundaries or letters if using a grading scale.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Advanced formulas & examples</h4>
        <p>Examples of advanced gradebook formulas and conditional grading patterns you may use:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Conditional grading example: IF([Attendance]>=80, ([Final]*0.8)+([Bonus]*0.2), [Final]*0.8)</li>
          <li>Weighted average with multiple components: (0.3*[Quiz1])+(0.3*[Quiz2])+(0.4*[Final])</li>
          <li>Drop lowest of 3 quizzes: (SUM([Quiz1],[Quiz2],[Quiz3]) - MIN([Quiz1],[Quiz2],[Quiz3])) / 2</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are illustrative; adjust field names and syntax to your LMS's formula requirements.</p>

        <h4>Quick diagnostic checklist</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Are aggregation and category settings correct?</li>
          <li>Are activities sending grades to the gradebook?</li>
          <li>Have students submitted work or have grades been manually entered?</li>
          <li>Are any grade items hidden or excluded?</li>
          <li>Do roles and permissions allow viewing/exporting grades?</li>
          <li>Have you tested with small sample data to reproduce the issue?</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Notes & Links</h4>
        <p>For persistent or complex issues, consider:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Checking your LMS's debug logs and gradebook reports.</li>
          <li>Verifying plugin compatibility (grading/reporting plugins can change behavior).</li>
          <li>Contacting your LMS administrator with exact reproduction steps and screenshots.</li>
        </ol>
